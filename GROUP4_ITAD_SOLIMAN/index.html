      <h2>What is Technology?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        It might seem a straightforward question, but technology is about more than gadgets and gizmos. The role and
        impact of technology in both our personal and working lives is ever growing. Understanding how
        people shape technology and how technology shapes people's interactions with each other and the natural world is
        important - not only for those who research, develop and implement new technologies, but also for all those
        people and organisations that have to use those technologies in their working and personal lives.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        There are three important aspects to this definition:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>1. Technology is about taking action to meet a human need rather than merely understanding the workings of the
        natural world, which is the goal of science. The invention of the microscope was driven by a need to explore the
        world of the small, beyond our unaided vision. This technological solution to a long standing problem has in
        turn enabled us to understand more the workings of the world which in turn has led to the development of more
        technologies.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>2. It uses much more than scientific knowledge and includes values as much as facts, practical craft knowledge
        as much as theoretical knowledge. The iPod is an example of where the physics of making a small device carry so
        much music is married with creative design to make an iconic must have accessory.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> 3. It involves organised ways of doing things. It covers the intended and unintended interactions between
        products (machines, devices, artifacts) and the people and systems who make them, use them or are affected by
        them through various processes. Many people like to drink coffee, often in a coffee shop. That coffee may have
        come from trees which have been bred specifically for increased yields that support a small farmer and his
        family but that requires pesticides that were developed and manufactured in another country. The harvested
        coffee beans will themselves be transported around the world, to be processed and placed in packages which are
        distributed to shops that then make the cup of coffee in a polystyrene cup that was manufactured for the purpose
        but which then needs to disposed of and so on. Every choice we make relies on, and feeds, a highly
        interdependent and far reaching way of life where some have much and some have little.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Technology is a hands-on, can-do profession where people have to be skilled in many of the following:
        engineering, communicating, designing, developing, innovating, managing, manufacturing, modelling, and systems
        thinking. But technology also gives us various products which can be used for good or ill or where the benefits
        are disputed and similarly the processes involved in producing and using technology means that we should all
        take an interest in whether it provides us and everyone else with a sustainable future.</p>
